# Heart_Disease_predictor
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR THE HEART DISEASE CLASSIFICATION
It predicts whether a person has heart disease or not.
 Objectives: 
• To employ machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support 
Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for 
predicting heart disease.  
• To increase model performance with Hyperparameters after GridSearchCV. 
• To compare all models in a uniform way with factors of performance in mind to 
check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and confusion matrix.  
• To determine the best algorithm according to performance results, with the trust 
factor taken into consideration.  
• To make an effort toward the creation of a feasibility decision-support system that 
could help to early diagnose heart disease.
